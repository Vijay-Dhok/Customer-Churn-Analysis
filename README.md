# Customer-Churn-Analysis
In this analysis, we explore customer churn patterns using data from a telecommunications company. Customer churn‚Äîthe rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity‚Äîis a critical metric for any subscription-based service. Reducing churn can significantly improve profitability and customer lifetime value.


# Data Cleaning & Preparation:

Convert columns to appropriate data types (e.g., handling TotalCharges).
Check and address missing or inconsistent values.
Ensure the data is suitable for analysis by transforming variables as needed (e.g., SeniorCitizen from numeric to categorical).

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize churn distribution across different customer segments.
Investigate how factors like gender, senior citizenship, and especially payment methods relate to churn.
Use bar plots, pie charts, and percentage breakdowns to communicate key findings.

# Insight Generation:

Identify the payment methods with the highest and lowest churn rates.
Quantify churn percentages to uncover behavioral patterns.
Propose actionable recommendations to help reduce churn based on insights derived from the data.

# üîç Insights:
Electronic Check users have the highest churn rate (45.29%), which is more than double that of other payment methods.

Automatic payment methods (Bank Transfer & Credit Card) show the lowest churn rates, suggesting convenience may help retain customers.

The mailed check method performs moderately well but still has a higher churn rate than automated options.

# ‚úÖ Recommendations:
Encourage Automatic Payments: Provide incentives (e.g., discounts or loyalty points) to customers who switch to bank transfer or credit card auto-pay.

Investigate Electronic Check Issues: Conduct surveys or gather feedback from customers using electronic checks to identify pain points.

Customer Education Campaign: Highlight the benefits and ease of using automatic payment methods through targeted emails or in-app banners.

Targeted Retention Strategies: Deploy personalized retention efforts for customers using manual methods, especially those on electronic check.
